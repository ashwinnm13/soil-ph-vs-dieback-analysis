## Soil pH vs Crown Dieback Analysis

This project explores the relationship between soil pH and crown dieback percentage
using basic statistical analysis and linear regression in Python.

### Methods Used
- Scatter plot visualization
- Pearson correlation analysis
- Linear regression using scikit-learn
- Model evaluation using R² score

### Key Findings
- Weak positive correlation between soil pH and dieback
- R² ≈ 0.02 (soil pH explains ~2% of the variation)
- Indicates soil pH alone is not a strong predictor

### Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy
- scikit-learn

### Learning Outcome
This project emphasizes honest interpretation of data and understanding
model limitations in real-world biological datasets.
